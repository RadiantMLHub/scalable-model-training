This tutorial delves into building a scalable model on the LandCoverNet dataset.

In this notebook, a portion of the tutorial:

1. We will authenticate to MLHub via the API key to make requests on the LandCoverNet label collection

2. We will download the label collection into PC

3. We will perform some exploratory data analysis on these labels to get a better understanding of the LandCoverNet data
